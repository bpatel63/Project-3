      <h2> My Favorite Hobby: Photography </h2>
        <p> Photography has always been one of my favorite hobbies. When I take pictures, it is like seeing new things in a new perspective literally and 
            figuratively. From photography, I have realized that getting a different view of things means you have a more open mind to the world, which is
            why it is always been my favorite hobby. </p>
            
        <p> People who are into preserving memories by getting great pictures would definitely love photography. Most people would agree that photography is a
            great hobby. While it easily gets the mood going, there are tips and tricks on how you can enjoy the hobby while taking beautiful pictures. As an
            enthusiast, you donâ€™t have to be highly skilled in order to choose photography as a favorite hobby. </p>
            
        <p> Photography is the art of capturing things or moments of your life by means of using a light-sensitive material such as photographic film or an image
            sensor. A camera is used to create durable images by recording light. Although it may sound quite complicated, all you need to do is click a button for
            the camera to capture the image that you want. According to most photographers, photography can be quite addictive, especially if you love taking records
            of the special moments of your life that you value most. </p>
